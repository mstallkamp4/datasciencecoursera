Make plots only in the training set
Look for
- Imbalances in outcomes / predictors
- Outliers or weird groups
- Groups of points that not explained by a predictors
- Skewed variables

Feature creation
Level 1 feature creation
1.  SCIENCE (application specific knowledge) IS KEY-  Google "feature extraction for ....(voice / image, etc)"
2.  Err on overcreation of features
3.  In some applicaitons (images, voices) automate feature creation is necessary
	->  Deep learning 
	
	Level 2 feature creation
1.   The function preProcess in caret will handle some preprocessing
2.  Create new covariates if you think they will improve fit
3.  Use EDA on the training set
4.  Be careful about overfitting!

preprocessing with caret

If you want to fit spline models use the gam method
