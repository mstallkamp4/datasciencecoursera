#Cleaning Data - Peer Reviewed Assignment
This peer reviewed assignment is to test the ability to create a clean data set.  The data set in question is taken from a study on smart phones.  The raw data can be found in the data folder in this project and also at the link below:

The requirements of the assignment are as follows:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Files
1.  recipie.R - The recipie script that contains 
2.  FirstTidySet.txt - This is the first set that is produced by recipie.R.  It contains a tidy data set of mean and std measures from the source data that is not aggregated.
3.  SecondTidySet.txt - This is the second set that is produced by recipie.R.  It contains a tidy data set of mean and std measure from the source data is aggregated and grouped by subject and activity.
4.  Readme.md - You are reading it now!  This file contains a summary of all files as well as the purpose of the experiment.
5.  Codebook.md - This is the codebook that contains information about the variables and summary choices in recipie.R
6.  Data (folder) contains the raw data for this experiment.
