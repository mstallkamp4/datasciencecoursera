"Atomic classes of objects"

1.  Character
2.  Numeric (real numbers)
3.  Integer
4.  Complex
5.  Logical (true / false)

Most basic object is a vector

vector can only contain objects of the same classes
->  Except lists

Empty vectors can be created with the vector(class, length) function

Numbers are treated as numeric
->  If you want inteers you have to specify the L Suffix (example:  1L)

Inf = Infinity
NaN - Not Defined

Attribues 
	R objects can have:
	- Names, dimnames
	- dimensions
	- Class
	- Length
	- Other user defined attributes/metadata
* Accessed with the attributes() function

c() funciton - Concatinate 

Data type conversions
-Goes to least common denominator
y <- c(1.7, "a")  #character
y <- c(T, 2)  	  #numeric
y <-c("a", TRUE)  #character

Explicit Conversion
x<-0:6

class(x)

Textual Formats
	- dumping and dputing are useful becuase the resulting textual format is edit-able , and in the case of corruption, potentially recoverable
	- Preserves metadata (which outtable and csv do not do)
	- Not space efficient
	
Subsetting
	"[" - always returns an object of the same class
		- can be used to select more than one element
	"[["- used to extract elements of a list or data frame
		- can only be used to extract a single element and will not necessary be a list or data frame
	"$"	- used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name
	   - semantics are simliary to "[["
